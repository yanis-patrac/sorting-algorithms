# Sorting Algorithms Visualization Project

This project aims to provide an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms using Python and tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Project Context

Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous practical applications. This project was developed to assist students and enthusiasts in understanding and visually comparing different sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms Used

Here are the sorting algorithms implemented in this project:

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Comb Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script and is accompanied by a visualization function to observe the sorting process step by step.
## Fast Fast

Based on the provided execution times for sorting algorithms, here are the observations:

Selection Sort: 0.025 seconds
Bubble Sort: 0.053 seconds
Insertion Sort: 0.019 seconds
Merge Sort: 0.002 seconds
Quick Sort: 0.002 seconds
Heap Sort: 0.002 seconds
Comb Sort: 0.001 seconds
Observations:

Efficiency: Merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and comb sort exhibit significantly faster execution times compared to selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort. This indicates that these algorithms are more efficient for sorting larger lists of real numbers.

Comparison: Among the faster algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and comb sort), comb sort has the lowest execution time, suggesting it may be the most suitable choice for sorting real numbers in this scenario.

Consideration: While merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort are known for their efficiency in general cases, comb sort may be preferred due to its faster execution time specifically for sorting real numbers.

These observations can guide the choice of sorting algorithm for sorting lists of real numbers efficiently in various applications.
